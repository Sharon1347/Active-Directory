# Active Directory Home Lab (Red & Blue Team Lab)

This project showcases a hands-on Active Directory lab environment designed for practicing both offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) cybersecurity techniques.

I set up a realistic virtual environment with multiple machines to simulate a real-world enterprise network, performed attack simulations, and monitored the network activity using security tools.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Lab Workflow & Tasks Performed

### ‚úÖ 1. Domain Controller (Windows Server 2025)
- Installed Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS).
- Configured the domain: `MYDFIR.LOCAL`.
- Promoted the machine to a Domain Controller.
- Set up DNS and other required services.

### ‚úÖ 2. Domain Join (Windows 11 Workstation)
- Configured network settings to point to the Domain Controller‚Äôs DNS.
- Joined Windows 11 machine to the domain `MYDFIR.LOCAL`.
- Verified successful domain join using PowerShell commands:
  - `whoami`
  - `nltest /dsgetdc:mydfir.local`
- Synced time using:
  - `w32tm /resync`
- Rebooted the machine to apply changes.

### ‚úÖ 3. Installed Splunk (on Ubuntu)
- Installed Splunk for log analysis and monitoring.
- Configured Splunk to collect logs from Windows machines.
- Added Sysmon logs to Splunk for deeper visibility.

### ‚úÖ 4. Installed Sysmon (on Windows Machines)
- Deployed Sysmon for detailed event logging on Windows.
- Forwarded Sysmon logs to Splunk.

### ‚úÖ 5. Attack Simulation (on Kali Linux)
- Attempted brute-force attacks on the Windows 11 machine using `xfreerdp` and custom Python scripts.
- Verified successful authentication via brute-force on RDP.
- Captured logs of these attacks in Splunk.

### ‚úÖ 6. Security Detection (on Splunk)
- Reviewed and analyzed the logs from Sysmon and Splunk.
- Verified that Splunk successfully detected the attack activities.

## üî• Key Cybersecurity Skills Practiced:
- Active Directory Setup & Management.
- Domain Joining & Network Configuration.
- Brute-force Attack Techniques (Red Teaming).
- Logging & Security Monitoring with Splunk & Sysmon.
- Detection & Response Workflows (Blue Teaming).
- Using Security Tools like Atomic Red Team for Simulation.

---

## üìù Notes:
- The entire lab was run in a virtualized environment for educational purposes.
- Screenshots and documentation were carefully captured for transparency and reproducibility.
- All machines were isolated in a private network.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a full Active Directory environment build with integrated offensive and defensive cybersecurity practices. It highlights:
- My ability to deploy enterprise-grade security tools.
- My skills in both attacking and defending systems.
- My experience in documenting and explaining technical projects clearly.
